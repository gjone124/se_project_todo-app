# Simple Todo App

## Description

This project was created for Sprint 7 of the Triple Ten Software Engineering program. HTML, CSS, and Javascript files were provided. My job was to refactor the Javascript from being hardcoded to using Object=Oriented Programming.

## Functionality

This app allows users to:

- view the list of current tasks
- add tasks with a name and due date
- mark tasks as complete
- delete tasks

## Technology

This project uses the following technology and techniques:

- HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language): standard language used to create and design web pages
- CSS3 (Cascading Sytle Sheets): programming language styles web page (colors/fonts/spacing/positioning)
- Javascript (ES6+): programming language provides functionality and interactivity
- UUIDV4 (Universally Unique Identifier): randomly generates unique IDs for each task
- Modular Javascript: organizes code into reusable modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): uses classes and objects to create reusable and maintainable code
- Form Validation: ensures data entered by a user for a new task is valid

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages
