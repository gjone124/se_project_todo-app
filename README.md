# Simple Todo App

## Description

This project was created for Sprint 7 and Sprint 8 of the Triple Ten Software Engineering program. HTML, CSS, and Javascript files were provided.

For Sprint 7, my job was to refactor the Javascript from being hardcoded to using Object-Oriented Programming.

For Sprint 8, we were told to destructure the Javascript into additional classes and to create a new counter element (TodoCounter) that keeps track of the total number of tasks and the total number of tasks completed.

## Functionality

This app allows users to:

Sprint 7

- view the list of current tasks
- add tasks with a name and due date
- mark tasks as complete
- delete tasks

Sprint 8

- keep track of how many tasks are complete
- keep track of how many total tasks there are
- keep track of how many total tasks still need to be completed

## Technology

This project uses the following technology and techniques:

Sprint 7

- HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language): standard language used to create and design web pages
- CSS3 (Cascading Sytle Sheets): programming language styles web page (colors/fonts/spacing/positioning)
- Javascript (ES6+): programming language provides functionality and interactivity
- UUIDV4 (Universally Unique Identifier): randomly generates unique IDs for each task
- Modular Javascript: organizes code into reusable modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): uses classes and objects to create reusable and maintainable code
- Form Validation: ensures data entered by user for new task is valid

Sprint 8

- Destructuring: helps make code more concise and expressive, especially when working with objects and arrays; streamlines extracting values from complex structures and enhances readability
